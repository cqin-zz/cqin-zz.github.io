**Hey there, and welcome!**üëã I'm Chuan Qin -- glad you're here! <br>

I'm currently a power system research engineer at [Pacific Northwest National Laborartory](pnnl.gov) (PNNL), with over 7 years of experience in power system modeling and planning.<br>

I've worked on studies ranging from microgrids to large-scale, nationwide transmission planning. Before joining PNNL, I was a research assistant at [Washington State University](wsu.edu) and took care of website, servers, and YouTube at the [SGDRIL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJvYOVqPi-vM7nmR4qSxpmQ/videos) lab during my PhD journey (since Prof. Anurag Srivastava moved to WVU in 2022).<br>

I‚Äôm all about tackling real-world challenges, learning something new every day, and making a difference through my work. This site is a place where I share a bit about what I do, projects I‚Äôve worked on, and things I‚Äôm passionate about. Feel free to look around‚Äîand don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you want to connect! ü§ù
