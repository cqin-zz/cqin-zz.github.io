		"description": "Improving and expanding electric transmission infrastructure in the U.S. is critical to ensuring consumers across the country have access to reliable, affordable power when and where they need it and to enable us to integrate new, clean sources of energy generation into the grid. To understand the transformation needed to ensure the U.S. electric transmission system continues to reliably serve the nation’s electricity customers as the power sector evolves and transitions to cleaner resources, the U.S. Department of Energy's Grid Deployment Office led the multiyear National Transmission Planning Study (NTP Study) in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)."

		"description": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and National Renewable Energy Laboratory conducted a two-year study to investigate the potential of floating offshore wind (OSW) to help meet this need, while also enhancing the resilience of the nation’s western grid. The study is funded by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Grid Deployment Office and co-managed by DOE's Wind Energy Technologies Office. The study analyzes the costs and benefits of adding floating OSW turbines along the United States’ Pacific coast. It shows that floating OSW could bring 33 GW of energy to the western United States by 2050 and bolster the resilience of coastal communities."

A decentralized approach to a real-time distribution model was designed using distributed computing and edge-analytics to improve the observability of the distribution system. Composite load models for a combination of static, dynamic (induction motors), and aggregated DERs were integrated with a reduced order quasi-static transmission-distribution model while preserving controllable DERs."
