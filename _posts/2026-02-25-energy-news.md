## 🔴 Breaking & Market-Moving

### 1. OPEC+ Expected to Resume Modest Oil Production Hikes for April
**Source:** Bloomberg | **Published:** Feb 25, 2026
**Summary:** OPEC+ delegates told Bloomberg they expect the group to agree to restart modest production increases — roughly 137,000 barrels per day — at its video conference this weekend, ending a three-month output pause. The decision is unsettled, with escalating U.S.-Iran tensions clouding the outlook and potentially keeping a floor under oil prices despite the supply addition.

### 2. U.S.-Iran Tensions Drive Oil to Seven-Month Highs; API Crude Build Adds Uncertainty
**Source:** Market Insights / Price Group Energy Report | **Published:** Feb 25, 2026
**Summary:** Crude prices are hovering near seven-month highs as geopolitical risk from U.S.-Iran confrontation provides a floor, even as an unexpected API crude inventory build (announced Tuesday night) applied short-term downward pressure. The official EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report releases today and could significantly diverge from the API number. Natural gas futures (March NYMEX) traded around $2.82–$2.85/MMBtu as shoulder-season warm weather forecasts weigh on prices.

### 3. U.S. AI Boom "Faces Electric Shock" — Grid Falling Behind Data Center Demand
**Source:** EnergyNow / multiple outlets | **Published:** Feb 25, 2026
**Summary:** A surge of alarming analyses today points to a structural mismatch: hyperscaler AI capex is on track for $650B in 2026, but grid infrastructure, permitting, and generation capacity cannot keep pace. EIA data shows electricity demand driven by data centers is now the primary growth engine of U.S. power consumption, with Texas and mid-Atlantic grids under the most stress.
